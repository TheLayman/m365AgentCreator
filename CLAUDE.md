# Microsoft 365 Agent Development Context

## Platform Overview

Microsoft 365 Copilot provides three primary extensibility models:

### 1. Copilot Connectors
- **Purpose**: Ingest and index data from enterprise sources
- **Capabilities**: Enrich Copilot with organizational data while maintaining security
- **Types**: Prebuilt connectors for common apps, custom connectors for unique requirements

### 2. Agents (Current Project Focus)
- **Purpose**: AI-powered assistants that automate workflows and handle tasks
- **Types**: Declarative Agents and Custom Engine Agents
- **Deployment**: Prebuilt agents from Microsoft/partners or custom-built for specific needs

### 3. Microsoft 365 Copilot APIs
- **Copilot Retrieval API**: Access organizational knowledge
- **Copilot Chat API**: Integrate chat functionality
- **Copilot Interaction Export API**: Export conversation data
- **Copilot AI Meeting Insights API**: Extract meeting intelligence

## Agent Types and Development Approaches

### Declarative Agents
**Architecture**: Uses Copilot's orchestrator and foundation models with no additional hosting required.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Run on Microsoft 365 Copilot's trusted infrastructure
- Consistent UI experience within M365 apps (Teams, Word, Excel, Outlook)
- Built using instructions, actions, and knowledge tailored for business scenarios
- Must pass Responsible AI (RAI) validation checks

**Development Tools**:
- **No-code/Low-code**: Copilot Studio agent builder
- **Pro-code**: Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit with Visual Studio/VS Code

**Use Cases**:
- IT Self-Help agents using SharePoint knowledge
- Customer Support agents with integrated order systems
- HR assistance for employee onboarding
- Sales support with CRM integration

**Components**:
- App manifest
- App icons
- Declarative agents manifest
- Optional plugin manifest

### Custom Engine Agents (Current Project Type)
**Architecture**: Specialized agents with full control over workflows, AI models, and integrations.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Custom orchestration and workflow control
- Flexible AI model selection (foundation, fine-tuned, industry-specific)
- Proactive automation capabilities
- Requires additional hosting and compliance management
- Can integrate with external systems and APIs

**Development Approaches**:
- **Low-code**: Copilot Studio with built-in compliance
- **Pro-code**: Two SDK options:
  - Microsoft 365 Agents SDK (multi-channel, custom orchestration)
  - Teams AI Library (Teams-specific collaborative agents)

**Use Cases**:
- Legal case analysis with complex document processing
- Financial analysis with custom risk models
- Medical diagnosis support with specialized AI models
- Complex workflow automation across multiple systems

## Current Project Architecture

### Technical Stack
- **Framework**: `@microsoft/agents-hosting` for Express-based agent hosting
- **Language**: TypeScript with Node.js 18+
- **AI Integration**: Azure OpenAI client for LLM interactions
- **Deployment**: Playground mode for testing and development

### Key Project Files
- `src/agent.ts` - Main agent logic and LLM interaction handler
- `systemPrompt` variable (line 12) - Core instructions for the LLM
- Message handler (lines 25-45) - Processes user messages through Azure OpenAI
- Configuration files - Azure OpenAI client setup and environment variables

### Agent Architecture Components
1. **Azure OpenAI Client** (lines 6-11) - Configured for LLM communication
2. **AgentApplication Setup** (lines 14-18) - Core agent framework initialization
3. **Welcome Message Handler** (lines 20-22) - Initial user interaction
4. **Main Conversation Handler** (lines 25-45) - Primary message processing logic

## Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI

### Core Capabilities
- **Project Scaffolding**: `atk new` - Create agents using templates
- **Development**: `atk preview` - Real-time app preview and testing
- **Validation**: `atk validate` - Ensure compliance and correctness
- **Deployment**: `atk deploy` - Deploy to Microsoft 365 environments
- **Publishing**: `atk publish` - Publish to Microsoft 365 app catalog

### Available Templates
- **basic-custom-engine-agent**: TypeScript agent with Azure OpenAI (current project)
- **declarative-agent**: Low-code declarative agent template
- **weather-agent**: Sample weather information agent
- **Custom templates**: Organization-specific agent templates

### Development Workflow
1. **Create**: `atk new -c basic-custom-engine-agent -l typescript`
2. **Configure**: Set up Azure OpenAI credentials and environment
3. **Develop**: Modify agent logic, system prompts, and integrations
4. **Test**: Use playground mode for development testing
5. **Validate**: Ensure compliance with RAI and security requirements
6. **Deploy**: Provision cloud resources and deploy to production

## Development Guidelines

### Agent Behavior Customization
- **System Prompt**: Modify `systemPrompt` variable to change agent personality and capabilities
- **Message Processing**: Update handler logic for different interaction patterns
- **Integration Points**: Add external API calls, database connections, or service integrations
- **Multi-modal Support**: Integrate document processing, image analysis, or voice capabilities

### Best Practices for Custom Engine Agents
1. **Responsible AI Compliance**:
   - Implement content filtering and safety measures
   - Ensure data privacy and security protocols
   - Monitor for bias and harmful outputs

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement efficient prompt engineering
   - Use appropriate model selection for use cases
   - Optimize response times and resource usage

3. **Integration Patterns**:
   - Use Microsoft Graph API for M365 data access
   - Implement secure authentication (Microsoft Entra ID)
   - Follow enterprise security and compliance standards

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test across multiple Microsoft 365 applications
   - Validate conversation flows and edge cases
   - Ensure accessibility and internationalization support
